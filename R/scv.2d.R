#' Function performing two-dimensional decomposition of the squared
#' coefficient of variation (SCV)
#'
#' @param data Data frame containing income data. Must contain at least one
#' column with numeric values.
#' @param total String specifying the name of the column containing data on
#' total income.
#' @param feature String specifying the name of the column containing
#' information about the feature used for inequality decomposition. If left
#' blank, total income is not decomposed by feature.
#' @param sources Vector containing strings specifying the names of the columns
#' with data on income sources, the sum of which must be equal to total income.
#' If left blank, or the same value as in "total" is specified, then total
#' income is not decomposed by income source.
#' @param weights String specifying the name of the column containing population
#' weights.
#' @param perc If set to TRUE, then the function returns percentage shares of
#' every inequality component in overall inequality. Set to FALSE by default.
#'
#' @description The function performs two-dimensional decomposition of the
#' squared coefficient of variation according to Garcia-Penalosa & Orgiazzi
#' (2013). That is, the coefficient can be decomposed by some feature that
#' members of the studied population possess (e.g., sex, education, age) and
#' their income source at the same time.
#'
#' @return Data frame containing values of components of SCV.
#'
#' Columns of the data frame represent values of the feature used for
#' decomposition. There can be inequality within groups formed by this feature
#' and between them - there are twice as much columns as values of the given
#' feature. Whether a column contains a value of within or between-group
#' inequality is indicated by ".W" and ".B" suffixes respectively.
#'
#' Every row of the data frame represents an income source.
#'
#' Thus, every value in this data frame is the contribution of inequality in
#' income earned from i-th source by members of j-th population cohort to
#' overall income inequality.
#'
#' Remember that overall SCV, which is the sum of all values in the data
#' frame, is always positive. However, some components of the coefficient can
#' have negative contribution to inequality.
#'
#' If all members of the studied population earn the same income, SCV normally
#' must be equal to zero. But, scv.2d calculates "alpha," which is the absolute
#' contribution of the given income source to overall inequality. Its
#' calculation is impossible for identical incomes because the formula involves
#' division by variance of income, which is zero in this case. Thus, the
#' function will return the NaN value.
