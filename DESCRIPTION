Description: Decomposition of income inequality by groups formed of individuals 
    possessing similar characteristics (e.g., sex, education, age) and their 
    income sources at the same time.
    Decomposition of the Theil index is based on Giammatteo, M. (2007) 
    <https://www.lisdatacenter.org/wps/liswps/466.pdf>.
    Decomposition of the squared coefficient of variation is based on
    Garcia-Penalosa, C., & Orgiazzi, E. (2013) <doi:10.1111/roiw.12054>.
